**Challenge-4-Soccer-Scripting-GameUp24** is a Unity game where the player controls a soccer ball to navigate through a game world filled with obstacles, enemies, and collectible power-ups. The game leverages Unity’s physics engine to simulate the ball’s movements and interactions with other objects in the environment.
